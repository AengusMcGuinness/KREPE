#WELCOME to the tutorial for INSERT NAME HERE


## In this tutorial we will walk you through how to use this package effectively and will teach you the basics of biology that works behind the python script.

'The basics of the program lie in k-mers. K-mers are used in bioinformatics to assemble genomes, perform analysis, and gain a general picture of a sample. K-mers are substrings of a sequence. K is a positive integer that varies with accuraccy needs. In our K-mer Counting program, we create a dictionary that indexes eash k-mer and increments with each occurence. Then, the dictionary deletes out the k-mers that occur only once. This is to get rid of any error reads that might be present in the sample. The code that performs the activity is shown below.'

'Next in the code, there is a section that can plot frequency graphs. This is quite useful for looking at the general "shape" of a read. A plot will typically look something like this:'
