* Kmer_Counter.py: A Comprehensive Guide 
** Visualizations
   Kmer_counter is a python command line tool within the krepe package that allows bioniformaticions
   to count the kmers with a .fasta, .fna, or .fastq file. Kmer_counter lets the user create bar graphs
   that represent all of the kmers at length k present in a file along with their abundance. Kmer_counter 
   also provides a simple uncompressed De Bruijn graph that is ideal for smaller values of k and is a nice
   visualization of the genome.
** Execution
   After making the script executable using chmod +x you can run the program with
   ./$PATH/Kmer_counter.py KMER_LENGTH FILE BAR_GRAPH DE_BRUIJN_GRAPH
   Or using python3
   python3 $PATH/Kmer_counter.py KMER_LENGTH FILE BAR_GRAPH DE_BRUIJN_GRAPH
** Tutorial
   Using the example data from NCBI:
   Navigate to the tests folder and retrieve Kmer_Counter.py and the files labeled '
   The bar graph has two options: 'plot_distribution' and 'not_plot_distribution'.
   The De Bruijn graph also has two arguments: 'plot_de_bruijn' and 'not_plot_de_bruijn'.
   An example usage would be:
   $  python3 Kmer_counter.py 25 plot_distribution not_plot_de_bruijn 
   The output should look something like this:
