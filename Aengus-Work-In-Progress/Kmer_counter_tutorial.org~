* Kmer_Counter.py: A Comprehensive Guide 
** Visulizations
   Kmer_counter is a python command line tool within the krepe package that allows bioniformaticists to count the kmers with a .fasta, .fna, or .fastq file.
   Kmer_counter lets the user create bar graphs that represent all of the kmers at length k present in a file along with their abundance.
   Kmer_counter also provides a simple uncompressed de bruijn graph that is ideal for smaller values of k and is a nice visualization of the genome.
** Execution
   After making the script executable using chmod +x you can run the program with
   ./$PATH/Kmer_counter.py KMER_LENGTH FILE BAR_GRAPH DE_BRUIJN_GRAPH
   Or using python3
   python3 $PATH/Kmer_counter.py KMER_LENGTH FILE BAR_GRAPH DE_BRUIJN_GRAPH
** Tutoial
   Using the example data from NCBI download or navigate to the tests folder and retrieve
   The bar graph has two options plot_distribution, not_plot_distribution
   The de bruijn graph also has two arguement plot_de_bruijn not_plot_de_bruijn
   An example usage would be python3 Kmer_counter.py 25 plot_distribution not_plot_de_bruijn
