## DESCRIPTION:
 The goal of the project is to create a streamlined, easy to use
 package and command line tool that allows users to count k-mers
 (nucleotide sequences of length k) and easily generates the
 following:

 - A list of the occurring k-mers in the given file that occur more
   than once
 - A histogram that shows the frequency of said k-mer occurrence
 - A De Bruijn graph that can then be used for genome assembly
